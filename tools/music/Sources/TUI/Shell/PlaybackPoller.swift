/// Background thread that polls Apple Music on its own cadence and publishes
/// snapshots to a NowPlayingStore. Decouples poll latency (~50-500ms per
/// AppleScript call) from the main loop's input/redraw latency, so the live
/// now-playing bar advances while the user is idle and input never freezes
/// waiting on a poll.
///
/// Threading contract: `running` is the only field touched from two threads;
/// it is guarded by `lock`. The poll cadence is `intervalMs`. On `stop()` the
/// loop exits after its current iteration and signals `finished`; `stop()`
/// waits briefly so the main loop can leave raw mode after the poller is idle.
