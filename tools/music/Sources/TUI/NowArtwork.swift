// The Now tab's REST artwork fallback: when the playing track carries no
// embedded artwork (`extractArtwork()` found zero `artworks of current track`
// — true of every track on "People's Instinctive Travels a", A Tribe Called
// Quest), resolve the SAME library album cover the Library tab renders, so the
// two tabs stop disagreeing about the same album.
//
// Route (all three alternatives were probed live 2026-07-15 before this one
// was chosen — see docs/deferred.md):
//   1. library SEARCH by album name — REJECTED. It matches the album NAME
//      only (never artistName, so appending the artist misses EVERY album:
//      "Midnight Marauders" hits, "Midnight Marauders A Tribe Called Quest"
//      returns nothing) and is inconsistent even on names: the exact string
//      "People's Instinctive Travels a" returns nothing while the single word
//      "instinctive" returns that very album.
//   2. walking /v1/me/library/albums (the Library tab's own source) — correct
//      but 2914 albums / 30 requests / 35.8s on this library. Too slow to
//      resolve one cover, and the Radio tab already taught us what a long
//      network stall costs.
//   3. library song-search by TRACK TITLE, then the song's `albums`
//      relationship — CHOSEN. Two targeted requests, and the relationship
//      returns the same library album object (same id, same artwork URL)
//      `libraryAlbums()` hands the Library tab.
//
// Search flakiness is absorbed by trying the exact title first and then a
// short prefix of it (live: "The Baron Sleeps and Dreams" returns nothing but
// "The Baron" returns it). Wrong hits can't leak through: a candidate is only
// accepted when its artist matches, so a miss degrades to the gradient rather
// than to somebody else's cover. No new REST client — this is the existing
// `search()` plus one relationship read.
