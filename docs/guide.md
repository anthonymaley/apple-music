# Apple Music Plugin — Complete Guide

## What Is This?

A Claude Code plugin that gives you full control over Apple Music from the terminal. Play music, manage AirPlay speakers, search the catalog, build playlists, discover new tracks — without leaving your coding session.

## Naming

One name for everything: **`music`**.

| Surface | Name | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Marketplace listing | Apple Music for Claude Code | `/plugin marketplace add anthonymaley/apple-music` |
| Skill (natural language) | `/music` | `/music play kid a in the kitchen at 60`, or just talk to Claude |
| CLI binary | `music` | `music now`, `music search "Fouk"` |

The `name` field in `plugin.json` is `music` — this is what makes the skill appear as `/music` in the menu. "Apple Music" appears in descriptions and docs for discoverability. There are no per-action slash commands: the skill is the plugin's single entry point.

## Command Vocabulary

Document clear long-form commands as the primary surface. Short forms are allowed as aliases, but they should not be the only documented path.

Primary examples:

- `music now`, not only `music np`
- `music volume`, not only `music vol`
- `music speaker wake`, not an implicit wake hidden behind `music play`

This keeps the command palette, README, and marketplace copy searchable while still allowing fast terminal aliases for experienced users.

## How Users Interact

There are five interaction layers, from quickest to most flexible:

### 1. Media Keys (transport)

Play/pause, next, and previous live on your keyboard (⏯ ⏭ ⏮). They control Apple Music natively through macOS — from any app, with zero setup, zero tokens, and no plugin surface at all. The plugin deliberately ships no slash commands for transport: a hardware key beats any typed command.

### 2. Natural Language (Skill — `/music`)

The plugin's single entry point in Claude Code. Say what you want — playback with routing, search, library, playlists, discovery — and Claude composes the right `music` CLI calls.

```
> /music play kid a in the kitchen and living room at 60%
> play some Daft Punk on the kitchen speaker
> add the living room to the group and turn it down to 40
> find me something like what's playing and make a playlist
> what's new from Radiohead?
> make me a mix from Fouk and Floating Points
```

Play-shaped requests are a fast path: the skill forwards your words to `music play`, whose parser deterministically extracts the query, speaker names (several at once), filler words, and volume. Naming speakers plays on exactly those speakers. Everything else is genuine composition — multiple CLI calls chained by Claude.

The skill triggers automatically when Claude detects music-related intent; `/music` invokes it explicitly. Requires the CLI to be built (one command: `scripts/install.sh`) — if it's missing, the skill says so and points at the script.

### 3. Interactive TUI

Run bare `music` in a real terminal for the unified interactive shell — a tabbed interface with **Now**, **Playlists**, **Speakers**, and **Library** tabs.

```
music                           Unified shell: Now / Playlists / Speakers / Library tabs
```

Current TUI contract:

- The Playlists tab does not fetch tracks on every playlist highlight; it loads tracks on selection. `/` filters the playlist rail as you type (arrows still navigate while filtering).
- Apple-curated playlists added to the library (AppleScript class `subscription playlist`) appear in the rail with an `APPLE` badge. They're read-only on Apple's side — edits fail with a toast, by design.
- Selecting a playlist pins it on the Now tab, which shows the full playlist and keeps `↑↓` navigation local.
- The Now tab shows the current album context, not a real Apple Music queue.
- The Library tab (requires the Apple Music user token) browses your library via the REST library API in three sub-views — Artists, Albums, Songs (opens on Artists) — switched with `[`/`]`. Enter opens an album's tracks or drills Artist → their albums → tracks; `p` plays and `s` shuffles the focused item (albums/artists play as app-owned queues — a scoped, navigable Up Next that stops at the album's end; needs Music's Autoplay ∞ off). Without a user token the tab refuses with a toast.
- `Enter` plays the highlighted row.
- Keys: `1/2/3/4` jump to a tab, `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` cycle, `[`/`]` switch Library sub-view, `↑↓` + `PgUp/PgDn/Home/End` navigate, `Space` play/pause, `</>` previous/next, `[ ]` seek (Now) / `←→` per-speaker volume (Speakers), `z` shuffle-play, `l` favorite, `+/-` master volume, `n` next-up options, `Esc` back, `q` quit.
- The Now tab has a **playback-control grid** (Shuffle / Order / Repeat / Genius) under the track progress, showing each value live with the active one lit. Press `←` to focus the grid and `→` to return to the Up Next list; `↑↓` move between control rows and `Enter` cycles the focused row's value (Shuffle on/off, Order Songs→Albums→Groupings, Repeat Off→All→One, Genius triggers). The `s`/`m`/`r`/`g` keys do the same from anywhere. Shuffle/order/repeat write Music's state directly (no extra permission); Genius rebuilds the queue from the current song and is UI-scripted (needs the same Accessibility permission as the equalizer). Distinct from the global `z`, which shuffle-*plays* the current context.
- Named-speaker `music play`, and `music speaker` add/`set`/`only`, verify the route automatically while playing (network-truth — established TCP connections to the speaker, not the AppleScript `selected` claim, which can lie) and print `✓ <speaker> verified (…)`; while paused, routing prints `Route set; will verify on next play.` instead, since a paused route can't be network-verified. An unestablished route triggers an automatic heal — an away-and-back reroute, then a transport-cycle reset — before an honest failure names the manual fix. `music speaker wake` also verifies first now and resets only the routes that are actually broken (`✓ X verified — leaving it alone.` for the rest). Routing to the Mac's own output is never "verified" — local output has no AirPlay session.
- Toggling a speaker on in the Speakers scene while playing verifies the route the same way and toasts if it couldn't be verified; toggling off, or toggling while paused, skips verification.
- The Speakers scene has an **EQ block**: an `EQ on/off` power row (`Enter` toggles it; `e` does the same from anywhere in the scene) and a `Preset` row beneath it — `Enter` expands an inline preset picker (venue pack first, then Music's built-in presets), `↑↓` to navigate, `Enter` to select and auto-enable EQ, `Escape` to collapse without changing the preset. With the Preset row highlighted but the picker collapsed, `←`/`→` quick-cycles presets one at a time.
- Below the EQ block, a **Visualizer** row toggles Music's on-screen visualizer (`Enter`, or `v` from anywhere in the scene). GUI-only — the visuals render in the Music window on the Mac's display, and turning it on brings Music forward.
- Music's Autoplay (∞) must stay OFF — playlist track-selection drives playback track-by-track and relies on each track stopping at its end.

### 4. Status Line

A passive display at the bottom of Claude Code showing what's playing — track, speakers, volume. Always visible, zero token cost.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  claude >                                                    │
│                                                              │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ▶ Everything In Its Right Place — Radiohead  ·  Kitchen [60]│
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Enable in `~/.claude/settings.json` (after running `scripts/install.sh`, which installs the script to a stable, update-proof path):

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.local/bin/music-statusline"
  }
}
```

### 5. Direct CLI (`music`)

For power users who want to use music outside Claude Code — in scripts, shell aliases, or other tools. The CLI has `--json` output for every command, making it scriptable.

```bash
music now --json
music search "Fouk" --limit 20 --json
music add --to "House"             # add current song to a playlist
music remove                       # remove current song from current playlist
music speaker verify --json        # network-truth verdict for selected speakers
music playlist list --json
```

Errors go to **stderr** (and `--json` mode emits an error object rather than corrupting the stream), so stdout stays clean for piping; previously-silent failures — a failed AirPlay route, a malformed config, dropped playlist indices — now print a `✗`/`⚠` line.

### How a play request executes

```
User says:  /music play Fouk in the kitchen and living room at 60%

1. Claude detects music intent → loads music skill
2. Fast path: forwards the words to the CLI in ONE call
   music play Fouk in the kitchen and living room at 60
3. The CLI's PlayParser (deterministic, unit-tested) extracts:
   query "Fouk" · speakers Kitchen, Living Room · volume 60
4. Routes to exactly those speakers, sets volume, plays
5. Verifies each route (network-truth) once playback starts;
   an unestablished route heals automatically before an honest failure
```

### How a composition request executes

```
User says:  "find me something like what's playing and make a playlist"

1. Claude detects music intent → loads music skill
2. Skill provides full music CLI reference to Claude
3. Claude composes commands:
   music similar --json
   music playlist create-from "Track 1" "Artist 1" "Track 2" "Artist 2" --name "Discovered"
   music play "Discovered" shuffle
4. Claude executes via Bash tool (chained with &&)
5. Claude summarizes results in natural language
```

### How the status line works

```
Every few seconds, Claude Code runs statusline.sh:

1. Script checks: is music installed?
   ├─ YES → music now --json → parse track, speakers, volume
   └─ NO  → osascript (raw AppleScript query)
2. Output: "▶ Track — Artist  ·  Speaker [Volume]"
3. Displayed at bottom of terminal, no tokens consumed
```

## Auth

The plugin works at three levels depending on what's configured:

| Level | What you need | What you get |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **No auth** | Just install the plugin | Playback, speakers, volume, now playing, shuffle, repeat |
| **Developer token** | Apple Developer account + MusicKit key | Above + catalog search (100M+ tracks) |
| **Full auth** | Above + user token from browser | Above + add to library, playlist CRUD, similar tracks, suggestions, new releases, mixes |

### Setting up auth

```bash
# 1. Configure your Apple Developer credentials
music auth setup
# Prompts for: Key ID, Team ID, path to .p8 key

# 2. Get a user token (opens browser)
music auth
# MusicKit JS page on localhost:8537 → authorize → token saved

# 3. Verify
music auth status
```

### Config files

```
~/.config/music/
├── config.json      # Key ID, Team ID, key path, storefront
├── AuthKey.p8       # Apple MusicKit private key (ES256)
└── user-token       # User token from MusicKit JS (~6 month expiry)
```

## Known Gotchas

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Parameter error (-50) | AppleScript can't set speaker + play in one call | Split into separate osascript calls (music does this) |
| Auth page won't load | MusicKit JS rejects `file://` origins | Auth page served via localhost:8537 HTTP server |
| MusicKit framework hangs | macOS CLI + MusicKit framework = deadlock | Use pure REST API + CryptoKit JWT instead |
| `MusicLibrary.add()` missing | iOS-only API | Library writes go through REST API |
| Library sync delay | REST writes take 1-3s to appear in AppleScript | LibrarySync model polls and retries |
| AirPods apostrophe | Names like "Anthony's AirPods Pro" break quoting | Speaker commands use fuzzy matching |
| Play shows "Nothing playing" | AppleScript `current track` unavailable during cold start | Retry loop waits up to 3s for track to load |
| ArgumentParser crash on bare invocation | Property wrappers crash when read on directly-constructed structs | Shared logic extracted to standalone functions |
| Speaker shows selected but stays silent (ghost) | Music's `selected`/`active` scripting read-backs can lie about the real session | Run `music speaker verify --json` before touching anything — keep the output as evidence |

## Version

v3.3.0 — all four locations stay in sync:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `version`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → `metadata.version`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → `plugins[0].version`
- `tools/music/Sources/Music.swift` → `CommandConfiguration(version:)` (rebuild via `scripts/install.sh` so `music --version` matches)
